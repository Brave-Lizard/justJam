"Thank you for allowing me to stay with you guys," Alphonso thanks you, "I've been in search of safety for a long while. I'll do anything I can to help you two. Is there anything you'd like me to do?"

"Anything you can. If you don't think you can do anything, then it's okay." |
"Humph. Just follow us and sit around like the useless bum you are." | 
"There's nothing much you can do. Just follow us and leech off our supplies." |
"Technically, we're only teleporting from place to place before we talk again or get in a game fight. So you can just fight with us." |
