"Hey! {Name}! I was wondering where you were. Do you want to come with me to the market again today?" 
"..." | "Why aren't you talking? Cat got your tongue?" | "..." | "Nothing, I was just thinking, sure I'll come." | "I don't want to talk to you." | "I'm not feeling well at the moment." | "We have no cats here." | "I'm going to take your silence as a yes, okay?" | "How mean! I don't care what you think, you're coming with me, okay?" | "Oh, that's unfortunate...but you're coming along anyway! We can get you some medicine." | "Ahaha! You're too funny. Come on, let's get going." 
"Sure! I'll come along." | "That's great! Come along, did you want anything at the market?" | "..." | "Yeah, I've been wanting to get something for some friends for a while now." | "No." | "I hate spending money, it'll make me poorer faster." | "I'm not sure, but I'll see when we're there." | "Nothing to say? It's fine if you don't want anything..." | "That's great! I wonder if you're going to get anything for me..." | "Oh, that's to bad..." | "I guess that's true...I guess that means you're not planning to pay for my stuff either, huh." | "Yeah! That's right, we will see." 
"No." | "What! That's not what you were supposed to say! You're coming with me whether you want to or not. It's what the program wants, you know?" | "..." | "You're right, ahaha!" | "It's not what I want though." | "You're being kind of mean..." | "The program?" | "Giving me the cold shoulder now? Well, that doesn't matter. Come on, let's go." | "I am right, aren't I? Come on, we have to get some food for dinner at the market, okay?" | "I'm not being mean! You are! Come on, we need to get something for dinner, okay?" | "That's right! The program! Doesn't it ever feel like life is just a simulation on some random person's computer? I mean, we're in medieval times, and I'm already mentioning modern technology! How weird is that? Come on, we need to get food for dinner, okay?" 
"What's the point of shopping, don't we already have enough stuff at home?" | "We need to buy food for dinner, silly! Come on, we can get you something sweet, okay?" | "..." | "Something sweet? Surely nothing is sweeter than you, right?" | "Humph." | "I don't like sweets." | "I don't know if we have enough money to buy sweets though." | "No complaints then? Okay!" | "Flattery will get you nowhere! Make sure to say stuff like that more often though, okay?" | "Don't humph me! Come on, it'll be fun, okay?" | "Well you're still coming along, okay?" | "It can't be that expensive. Just let me treat you, okay?" 
"I don't think that the game will let me do anything that will let me not come with you, so sure" | "That's right! The game won't let you not come, but it's okay. We get to spend more time together, after all!" | "..." | "Yeah, that is a pretty good upside." | "Humph." | "I wouldn't say that's a good thing." | "You're not confused at my sudden mention of game?" | "Come on, let's go!" | "I'm glad you agree!" | "Don't humph me! We need to get food for dinner, okay?" | "Ouch! Why would you say something so mean? | "@#^&^!&@^&&!#, so it's fine. Anyways, let's get going!"
