(After Main Menu) "Hey! {Name}! I was wondering where you were. Do you want to come with me to the market again today?" 
"..." | "Why aren't you talking? Cat got your tongue?" | "..." | "Nothing, I was just thinking, sure I'll come." | "I don't want to talk to you." | "I'm not feeling well at the moment." | "We have no cats here." | "I'm going to take your silence as a yes, okay?" | "Well, snap out of it! We're going shopping!" |"How mean! I don't care what you think, you're coming with me, okay?" | "Oh, that's unfortunate...but you're coming along anyway! We can get you some medicine." | "Ahaha! You're too funny. Come on, let's get going." 
"Sure! I'll come along." | "That's great! Come along, did you want anything at the market?" | "..." | "Yeah, I've been wanting to get something for some friends for a while now." | "No." | "I hate spending money, it'll make me poorer faster." | "I'm not sure, but I'll see when we're there." | "Nothing to say? It's fine if you don't want anything..." | "That's great! I wonder if you're going to get anything for me..." | "Oh, that's to bad..." | "I guess that's true...I guess that means you're not planning to pay for my stuff either, huh." | "Yeah! That's right, we will see." 
"No." | "What! That's not what you were supposed to say! You're coming with me whether you want to or not. It's what the program wants, you know?" | "..." | "You're right, ahaha!" | "It's not what I want though." | "You're being kind of mean..." | "The program?" | "Giving me the cold shoulder now? Well, that doesn't matter. Come on, let's go." | "I am right, aren't I? Come on, we have to get some food for dinner at the market, okay?" | "I'm not being mean! You are! Come on, we need to get something for dinner, okay?" | "Well, I do, and that's enough. Come on!" |"That's right! The program! Doesn't it ever feel like life is just a simulation on some random person's computer? I mean, we're in medieval times, and I'm already mentioning modern technology! How weird is that? Come on, we need to get food for dinner, okay?" 
"What's the point of shopping, don't we already have enough stuff at home?" | "We need to buy food for dinner, silly! Come on, we can get you something sweet, okay?" | "..." | "Something sweet? Surely nothing is sweeter than you, right?" | "Humph." | "I don't like sweets." | "I don't know if we have enough money to buy sweets though." | "No complaints then? Okay!" | "Flattery will get you nowhere! Make sure to say stuff like that more often though, okay?" | "Don't humph me! Come on, it'll be fun, okay?" | "Well you're still coming along, okay?" | "It can't be that expensive. Just let me treat you, okay?" 
"I don't think that the game will let me do anything that will let me not come with you, so sure" | "That's right! The game won't let you not come, but it's okay. We get to spend more time together, after all!" | "..." | "Yeah, that is a pretty good upside." | "Humph." | "I wouldn't say that's a good thing." | "You're not confused at my sudden mention of game?" | "Come on, let's go!" | "I'm glad you agree!" | "Don't humph me! We need to get food for dinner, okay?" | "Ouch! Why would you say something so mean? | "@#^&^!&@^&&!#, so it's fine. Anyways, let's get going!"
(After fighting tutorial and beating up some bullies) "Wow...I didn't know you were so skilled at fighting, {Name}..."
"..." | "Kind of freaky...but I'm glad that you would protect me like that." | "..." | "Of course, you're my friend." | "They were annoying me." | "People like that should just die..." | "I was just completing the tutorial." | "I've already got everything for dinner, so I'm just going to head home now. I'll see you later, okay?" | "Thank you...I'm going to get dinner prepared now. I'll see you at dinner, okay?" | "You shouldn't do anything drastic just because someone's annoying you...I'll see you later, okay?" | "Please don't actually kill them...that's kind of drastic. I'll see you later, okay?" | "Yes, but you still protected me. You could have easily clicked out of the game and leave me to fend for myself...Thank you, I'll see you at home, okay?"
"I just wanted you to be safe." | "I guess that means I don't need to worry about being in danger, huh? I'll see you at home, I need to go cook the food now, okay?" | "..." | "Be careful on your way home." | "Humph." | "Don't run into anymore bullies on the way home." | "I'll see you after the tutorial scenes end." | "Bye." | "And if I'm not, will you come to the rescue? I'm sure those bullies won't come after me now, so I'll be fine. It's not like a giant apocalypse of a sweet, preserved fruit often used as a condiment or spread on bread is going to happen before I get home." | "Why are you 'humph'-ing me! I'll see you at home, okay?" | "I don't think those bullies are coming after me after what you did to them. I think it's more likely that an apocalypse of jelly or jam, or something, will happen than those bullies coming back for more." | "You're right, make sure to save your game before you fight, okay? I don't want you to die permanently."
"Humph" | "What, are you trying to act cool? Why are you going, 'humph?'" | "..." | "I'm just playing around, I'll see you at home." | "Humph." | "Is that what you think?" | "Why would I need to act cool? I am cool." | "'Humph!' See? I can say it too. Humph! Harumph! I'll see you at home, okay?" | "Yeah, okay, I'll see you then!" | "Why are you saying it again! Geez, I'll see you at home, okay? Meet me whenever you're ready." | "Yes, it is. I'll see you at home, okay?" | "Ahaha! Sure you are. I'll see you at home, okay?"
"It's necessary when there's no telling when the next war will break out, or when a grand apocalypse will befall the land." | "What, are you expecting a giant flood of jam to destroy the world? You're too young to have to join the military, and don't think I'll let you join up with them. If they want to enlist you, they have to go through me!" | "..." | "I'm glad I have you to protect me..." | "Humph." | "You think you can stop the entire kingdom of Italy from recruiting me...?" | "Sure, all of Italy will follow your every command." | "All right, we should get going now, I'll be at home, okay?" | "That's right! But first comes dinner, I'll take care of it today, so meet me at home later, okay?" | "I'll see you at home, okay?" | "Yes. Before that though, I need to make dinner. I'll see you at home, okay?" | "That's right! Before I do all that though, I need to make dinner. I'll see you at home, okay?"
"Well, it was a tutorial, so I'm sure that the programmers made it so that I would win." | "Ahaha! I guess so, the actual game hasn't started yet, after all. Do you think you'll be able to keep protecting me when you're done with the tutorial?" | "..." | "If I'm protecting you, I'm sure of it. You're an important part of the main cast, so I doubt the programmers would make it easy to lose you." | "Humph." | "And how are you so sure I want to protect you?" | "Probably not. I'm a level 1." | "Your silence is kind of scary...but I trust you, okay? I'll see you at home." | "Ahaha! And you're sure I'm a part of the main cast, huh? I'll see you at home, okay? Then we can do some main cast things." | "Don't want to answer? That's fine. I'll see you at home, okay?" | "...That kind of hurts. I'll see you at home, okay {Name}?" | "Hey! Be more confident in yourself. There's more to fighting than your level. Except this is a game, so I guess there isn't more to it...Either way, I believe in you! I'll see you at home, okay?"
(After the tutorial and loss of Caputia...You gave the peanut butter to Juliet) "Everything...What's going on? There's all this jam everywhere...It's like it's alive!"
"..." | "Come on! Speak to me! We're in danger right now!" | "..." | "I'm sorry, I'm listening now. I'm just as shocked as you are..." | "Nah." | "It's all pointless now, our home is destroyed." | "Actually, we're not in danger, since the monsters aren't programmed to attack us while we're talking." | "Forget it! Just come with me, we might be able to find help in the nearby castle." | "It's okay... just stay sharp, okay? We should get moving to the nearby castle, maybe the local lord can help us." | "'Nah?!' Get a grip! We need to find safety! We're going to the castle, we might find help there." | "Pointless!? No! There's still hope. We're going to the castle, we might find help there." | "Oh. You're right. Still, let's go to the nearby castle. We might be able to find help there."
"Yeah...we need to stay calm. We need to find somewhere safe | "You're right, maybe if we went to the castle..." | "..." | "That's a good idea! Let's go!" | "Humph." | "Your idea sucks." | "Good idea, the soldiers might have survived." | "Come on! Let's go to the castle!" | "Okay!" | "Don't act so sulky! Let's get moving." | "How does it suck?! Just stick with me, okay? We're going to the castle." | "Yes, come on!"
"Quit acting scared, and man up." | "But I'm not a man!" | "..." | "Ahaha, I'm just kidding around. Lighten up." | "Well it's about time you became one." | "Which is a bummer." | "Then do the girl's equivalent and woman up, I guess." | "What's with your ominous silence!? Ugh, just come with me, there's a castle nearby that we can hideout in." | "I guess I've been acting tense for a while...okay. There's a castle nearby, we should go there." | "Hah!? No! What kind of joke is that? We should get moving, there's a nearby castle we can hide in." | "A bummer!? What are you trying to suggest there...Forget it for now! We need to find somewhere safe! There's a castle nearby, we can find safety there." | "I'm woman enough! Come on, there's a castle nearby, we can find safehaven there."
"And? I think it's the perfect time for a nap." | "No it's not! We need to get moving!" | "..." | "You're right, I guess we should get going then." | "You're such a nuisance, let me sleep." | "Good night, I'll see you in the afterlife." | "I can carry you when you nap, if you're alright with carrying me." | "Are you sleeping!? Get up! We need to get moving! There's a castle that we can take shelter in, okay? You can sleep there." | "I'm glad you can acknowledge that. Come on, there's a castle nearby that we can take shelter in." | "I'm not letting you sleep until we're safe! Come on, there's a castle nearby. I'll let you sleep in there, okay?" | "Stop! That's a death flag! You can't say that without saving your game first! Come on, there's a castle we need to get to for the game to progress, let's go."
"It's just your everyday apocalypse, nothing to worry about." | "Everyday apocalypse?! Now's not the time for jokes! Let's get moving." | "..." | "I thought a joke might help you calm down, sorry. Let's get moving to the nearby castle then." | "Can't take a joke, huh?" | "If now's not the time for jokes, when is? Our death is assured." | "Why aren't you talking? There's a castle nearby. If we're lucky, we can find some help there." | "W-what are you doing thinking about me in a situation like this?! Look, there's a castle nearby, we should take shelter there, okay?" | "Now's not the time for jokes, I said! There's a castle nearby, we'll take shelter there." | "You might have given up hope, but I haven't! There's a castle nearby, we can stay safe there."
(Alphonso has been met on the way to the castle known as Fort Night. Juliet has been wow'd by his amazing moves, and his mysterious, compact crossbow) "That guy was so cool, wasn't he? I mean, he dresses kind of weird, but he's so...capable."
"..." | "Why are you being all silent? Are you jealous?" | "..." | "...Maybe." | "What's there to be jealous of?" | "There's no point in being jealous. If he's so much better than me, go ahead and have an adventure with him on your own." | "He's just one variable in some random game, so there's no need to be jealous." | "Your silence isn't helping your case, you know? Come on, let's keep him on the team. He can be of help to us." | "Ahaha! You don't need to, okay? We'll always be friends. Come on, we should keep him on our team." | "...Me. Come on, let's keep him on our team. He'll be a big help for us later." | "I guess you're right. Maybe I'm just overreacting because of his modern technology. Either way, I think we should keep him with us. He might be able to keep us safe on our adventure." | "What, is he on a level below your high-level matrix that you live in? Come on, let's keep him. He might be able to help us."
"I know, right? He's so mysterious..." | "I think we're going to be a lot safer with him around, can we keep him? Pretty please?" | "..." | "Yes. He makes me feel safe as well." | "No." | "He might just die anyways, we should just leave him." | "I don't think you're old enough yet." | "Can I take that as a yes...?" | "Yay! We get to keep him!"   Juliet celebrates and jumps around. | "No! Please, please please, can we keep him?"     Juliet begs like a kid wanting to adopt a dog for her birthday. | "What! I think we're the ones that are more likely to die. We can at least keep him as a meat shield, right?"     Juliet casualy says something frightening. | "Old enough? What are we doing, adopting a dog!? Ahaha! I'll take good care of him, okay? I'll even pick up his droppings!"     Alphonso winces in the background of the screen, after being casually treated like a dog.
"He bothers me."| "Huh? He bothers you? Why? Is it because of me? Are you getting jealous?" | "..." | "...Maybe." | "What's there to be jealous of?" | "There's no point in being jealous. If he's so much better than me, go ahead and have an adventure with him on your own." | "He's just one variable in some random game, so there's no need to be jealous." | "Your silence isn't helping your case, you know? Come on, let's keep him on the team. He can be of help to us." | "Ahaha! You don't need to, okay? We'll always be friends. Come on, we should keep him on our team." | "...Me. Come on, let's keep him on our team. He'll be a big help for us later." | "I guess you're right. Maybe I'm just overreacting because of his modern technology. Either way, I think we should keep him with us. He might be able to keep us safe on our adventure." | "What, is he on a level below your high-level matrix that you live in? Come on, let's keep him. He might be able to help us."
"What, are you going to fall in love with him, or something?" | "Huh? No! Nothing like that, i-it's just that he's, you know, super cool." | "..." | "You know, I think you're cooler." | "Humph." | "He's not cool, he's just slightly below room temperature." | "Actually, the coolest he can be is at the temperature that the computer's cooling system allows him to be." | "Come on, can we keep him? I promise that I'll take good care of him." | "Really? Yay! Can we keep him though? I think he can be pretty useful in our journey. He is a time traveler after all." | "Can we keep him? I want to keep him. Let's keep him." | "Oh come on! He's at least somewehre around 40 degrees Fahrenheit!" | "Yeah, well the cooling system is making him cooler than everything else! Let's keep him, he can be of help to us later."
"Well, he's from the modern world, of course he's going to be cool." | "Yeah, modern technology is so cheat, but that's why he's cool. Can we keep him?" | "..." | "I mean, I guess..." | "No, wait until you're older." | "I don't think you should talk about him like he's a dog." | "We can always mug him and take his stuff." | "Can I take that as a yes...?" | "Yay!"   Juliet celebrates and dances around, like a kid being given a pet dog as a present. | "Until I'm older?! I'm an adult! I get to make my own decisions. Let's keep him!"     Alphonso looks a bit hurt, as the both of you refer to him as a dog. | "That's not what I mean! I just want to have someone who can protect us on our journey!" | A drop of sweat slides down Alphonso's cheek in the background, as a chill runs up his spine. Juliet works our her response, "I mean...I guess so...but I wanted to keep him alive."
(After Meeting Victorino) "Ugh, this guy is filthy. We should really leave him in the dust."
"..." | "Come on, make the right choice and leave him. We have enough people to worry about with just the three of us." | "..." | "I'm sorry that you think that way, but it's better to bring him along. He has skills we don't." | "Humph." | "You suck for saying that." | "The programmers didn't give us free choice here. We need to bring him. He's a developer favorite, as well as a role model to Alphonso." | "You better make the right choice." | "...Fine. If you insist so much." | "Come on, you better make the right choice." | "What right do you have to say that, huh!? Just leave him!" | "...I guess you're right about that...the will of the devolpers can't be ignored, after all."
"Your opinion is valid, we should definitely leave him in the dust." | "I'm glad you can see reason. I can't stand people that think they're so cool when they're not." | "..." | "I agree with you, but we need to take into accoun that the story isn't flexible enough to ignore a main cast member." | "You need to pipe down. Victorino is a good man." | "You're being very mean right now." | "The developers like him. We can't just leave him." | "Tch, you better make the right choice, okay?" | "Well I'm a main cast member too, okay!? So just leave him! All we need is us three!" | "Well I don't think so, okay!? Do as I say, and leave him!" | "Hah, Hahahah, don't try to lecture me! Just do as I say, okay!?" | "...I guess we can't go against the will of the developers. Fine. Okay. Go ahead then."
"Alphonso seemed to like him, don't you think we should keep his opinion in mind?" | "I do get that Alphonso likes him, but I think he's being blinded by Victorino's good looks." | "..." | "Are you okay? Why are you acting so stressed, Juliet?" | "You're being irrational. Just let him on the team." | "Are you suggesting that Victorino is seducing Alphonso?" | "Alphonso and Victorino were supposed to be the same character, according to the developer's original plans. This means, technically, they're the same person." | "Make the right choice and leave him." | "Everything's fine!"   Juliet shouts while stomping her foot. She glares, and you're left to make a decision. | "I'm not being irrational! You are! Listen to me, and leave him, okay!?" | "Uh, well, it's just-- Forget it! Just leave him, okay!?" | "I--...If it's the developer's will...then okay."
"You shouldn't call people filthy." | "I just don't like him, okay?! Just leave him!" | "..." | "Are you okay? You're acting really stressed." | "I don't need to listen to you." | "But Alphonso likes him..." | "If we leave him, he could die alone." | "Make the correct decision and leave him." | "Everything's fine!"    Juliet shouts while stomping her feet. | "Ugh! Fine! Do whatever then!" | "Fine! You can bring him, but only because Alphonso likes him." | Juliet's scowl breaks for a moment, before returning. She responds, "Fine."
"Victorino is one of the main casts. We can't just leave him out in the wild." | "Well, I'm a part of the main cast too, okay? So listen to what I have to say and leave him!" | "..." | "Is that what you really want to do?" | "Be quiet, your opinion doesn't matter." | "Does our opinion not matter?" | "It's better to stick together, the game was made with us being a group in mind." | "Make the correct choice. I'm waiting." | "...Just leave him okay?" | "You wanna fight? Just do as I say!" | "You want to make this about you? Well I have my opinion! Listen to it, okay!?" | "...Fine, since it's the devoloper's will..."
