(After Main Menu) "Hey! {Name}! I was wondering where you were. Do you want to come with me to the market again today?" 
"..." | "Why aren't you talking? Cat got your tongue?" | "..." | "Nothing, I was just thinking, sure I'll come." | "I don't want to talk to you." | "I'm not feeling well at the moment." | "We have no cats here." | "I'm going to take your silence as a yes, okay?" | "Well, snap out of it! We're going shopping!" |"How mean! I don't care what you think, you're coming with me, okay?" | "Oh, that's unfortunate...but you're coming along anyway! We can get you some medicine." | "Ahaha! You're too funny. Come on, let's get going." 
"Sure! I'll come along." | "That's great! Come along, did you want anything at the market?" | "..." | "Yeah, I've been wanting to get something for some friends for a while now." | "No." | "I hate spending money, it'll make me poorer faster." | "I'm not sure, but I'll see when we're there." | "Nothing to say? It's fine if you don't want anything..." | "That's great! I wonder if you're going to get anything for me..." | "Oh, that's to bad..." | "I guess that's true...I guess that means you're not planning to pay for my stuff either, huh." | "Yeah! That's right, we will see." 
"No." | "What! That's not what you were supposed to say! You're coming with me whether you want to or not. It's what the program wants, you know?" | "..." | "You're right, ahaha!" | "It's not what I want though." | "You're being kind of mean..." | "The program?" | "Giving me the cold shoulder now? Well, that doesn't matter. Come on, let's go." | "I am right, aren't I? Come on, we have to get some food for dinner at the market, okay?" | "I'm not being mean! You are! Come on, we need to get something for dinner, okay?" | "Well, I do, and that's enough. Come on!" |"That's right! The program! Doesn't it ever feel like life is just a simulation on some random person's computer? I mean, we're in medieval times, and I'm already mentioning modern technology! How weird is that? Come on, we need to get food for dinner, okay?" 
"What's the point of shopping, don't we already have enough stuff at home?" | "We need to buy food for dinner, silly! Come on, we can get you something sweet, okay?" | "..." | "Something sweet? Surely nothing is sweeter than you, right?" | "Humph." | "I don't like sweets." | "I don't know if we have enough money to buy sweets though." | "No complaints then? Okay!" | "Flattery will get you nowhere! Make sure to say stuff like that more often though, okay?" | "Don't humph me! Come on, it'll be fun, okay?" | "Well you're still coming along, okay?" | "It can't be that expensive. Just let me treat you, okay?" 
"I don't think that the game will let me do anything that will let me not come with you, so sure" | "That's right! The game won't let you not come, but it's okay. We get to spend more time together, after all!" | "..." | "Yeah, that is a pretty good upside." | "Humph." | "I wouldn't say that's a good thing." | "You're not confused at my sudden mention of game?" | "Come on, let's go!" | "I'm glad you agree!" | "Don't humph me! We need to get food for dinner, okay?" | "Ouch! Why would you say something so mean? | "@#^&^!&@^&&!#, so it's fine. Anyways, let's get going!"
(After fighting tutorial and beating up some bullies) "Wow...I didn't know you were so skilled at fighting, {Name}..."
"..." | "Kind of freaky...but I'm glad that you would protect me like that." | "..." | "Of course, you're my friend." | "They were annoying me." | "People like that should just die..." | "I was just completing the tutorial." | "I've already got everything for dinner, so I'm just going to head home now. I'll see you later, okay?" | "Thank you...I'm going to get dinner prepared now. I'll see you at dinner, okay?" | "You shouldn't do anything drastic just because someone's annoying you...I'll see you later, okay?" | "Please don't actually kill them...that's kind of drastic. I'll see you later, okay?" | "Yes, but you still protected me. You could have easily clicked out of the game and leave me to fend for myself...Thank you, I'll see you at home, okay?"
"I just wanted you to be safe." | "I guess that means I don't need to worry about being in danger, huh? I'll see you at home, I need to go cook the food now, okay?" | "..." | "Be careful on your way home." | "Humph." | "Don't run into anymore bullies on the way home." | "I'll see you after the tutorial scenes end." | "Bye." | "And if I'm not, will you come to the rescue? I'm sure those bullies won't come after me now, so I'll be fine. It's not like a giant apocalypse of a sweet, preserved fruit often used as a condiment or spread on bread is going to happen before I get home." | "Why are you 'humph'-ing me! I'll see you at home, okay?" | "I don't think those bullies are coming after me after what you did to them. I think it's more likely that an apocolypse of jelly or jam, or something, will happen than those bullies coming back for more." | "You're right, make sure to save your game before you fight, okay? I don't want you to die permanently."
"Humph" | "What, are you trying to act cool? Why are you going, 'humph?'" | "..." | "I'm just playing around, I'll see you at home." | "Humph." | "Is that what you think?" | "Why would I need to act cool? I am cool." | "'Humph!' See? I can say it too. Humph! Harumph! I'll see you at home, okay?" | "Yeah, okay, I'll see you then!" | "Why are you saying it again! Geez, I'll see you at home, okay? Meet me whenever you're ready." | "Yes, it is. I'll see you at home, okay?" | "Ahaha! Sure you are. I'll see you at home, okay?"
"It's necessary when there's no telling when the next war will break out, or when a grand apocalypse will befall the land." | "What, are you expecting a giant flood of jam to destroy the world? You're too young to have to join the military, and don't think I'll let you join up with them. If they want to enlist you, they have to go through me!" | "..." | "I'm glad I have you to protect me..." | "Humph." | "You think you can stop the entire kingdom of Italy from recruiting me...?" | "Sure, all of Italy will follow your every command." | "All right, we should get going now, I'll be at home, okay?" | "That's right! But first comes dinner, I'll take care of it today, so meet me at home later, okay?" | "I'll see you at home, okay?" | "Yes. Before that though, I need to make dinner. I'll see you at home, okay?" | "That's right! Before I do all that though, I need to make dinner. I'll see you at home, okay?"
"Well, it was a tutorial, so I'm sure that the programmers made it so that I would win." | "Ahaha! I guess so, the actual game hasn't started yet, after all. Do you think you'll be able to keep protecting me when you're done with the tutorial?" | "..." | "If I'm protecting you, I'm sure of it. You're an important part of the main cast, so I doubt the programmers would make it easy to lose you." | "Humph." | "And how are you so sure I want to protect you?" | "Probably not. I'm a level 1." | "Your silence is kind of scary...but I trust you, okay? I'll see you at home." | "Ahaha! And you're sure I'm a part of the main cast, huh? I'll see you at home, okay? Then we can do some main cast things." | "Don't want to answer? That's fine. I'll see you at home, okay?" | "...That kind of hurts. I'll see you at home, okay {Name}?" | "Hey! Be more confident in yourself. There's more to fighting than your level. Except this is a game, so I guess there isn't more to it...Either way, I believe in you! I'll see you at home, okay?"
(After the tutorial and loss of Caputia...You gave the peanut butter to Juliet) "Everything...What's going on? There's all this jam everywhere...It's like it's alive!" |
