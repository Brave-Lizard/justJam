(After the shopping spree with Juliet, you meet up with Caputia.) "Hey," she greets, "How are you doing? Do you like my dialogue?" Caputia flaunts her cool text descriptions that show along with her quotes, "isn't it so cool?"
"..." | "Not impressed? That's okay. I needed you to do something anyway." Caputia asks, "Could you steal something for me?" | "..." | "Sure! Anything you say!" | "I'm not a theif" | "I don't like stealing..." | "Wait, that's illegal." | "I will take that as a yes. Come with me, there's this peanut butter I want you to take." | "Good. Come with me, there's this peanut butter I want you to take..." | "Sure. Come with me anyway, there's this peanut butter I want you to take." | "Okay. Come with me anyway, there's this peanut butter I want you to take." | "That's right," Caputia replies, "There's this peanut butter I want you to take."
"Yeah, it's pretty great. I wish Juliet had them." | "Well, Juliet will never be as good as me, heh," Caputia brags, puffing out her chest with pride. "You know, there's something I'd like to steal. Can you help me?" | "..." | "Sure! Anything you say!" | "I'm not a theif" | "I don't like stealing..." | "Wait, that's illegal." | "I will take that as a yes. Come with me, there's this peanut butter I want you to take." | "Good. Come with me, there's this peanut butter I want you to take..." | "Sure. Come with me anyway, there's this peanut butter I want you to take." | "Okay. Come with me anyway, there's this peanut butter I want you to take." | "That's right," Caputia replies, "There's this peanut butter I want you to take."
"It's nothing special." | "Oh, I see, that's a bummer then," she laments, "that's not what I wanted to talk with you about though. There's something I want to steal with you." | "..." | "Sure! Anything you say!" | "I'm not a theif" | "I don't like stealing..." | "Wait, that's illegal." | "I will take that as a yes. Come with me, there's this peanut butter I want you to take." | "Good. Come with me, there's this peanut butter I want you to take..." | "Sure. Come with me anyway, there's this peanut butter I want you to take." | "Okay. Come with me anyway, there's this peanut butter I want you to take." | "That's right," Caputia replies, "There's this peanut butter I want you to take."
"No, I prefer not to be bombarded with your huge text walls." | "Okay, I'll make sure that narrator keeps quiet then," she says, but will never be able to do, "anyways, there's something we need to do. We need to steal something." | "..." | "Sure! Anything you say!" | "I'm not a theif" | "I don't like stealing..." | "Wait, that's illegal." | "I will take that as a yes. Come with me, there's this peanut butter I want you to take." | "Good. Come with me, there's this peanut butter I want you to take..." | "Sure. Come with me anyway, there's this peanut butter I want you to take." | "Okay. Come with me anyway, there's this peanut butter I want you to take." | "That's right," Caputia replies, "There's this peanut butter I want you to take."
"It's pretty nice. The narrator's my favorite character anyways." | Aww, thank you.     "Really? You prefer the monotone voice over mine?" Caputia exhales with disapointment. "Hey, there's something I want to do with you. We need to pull off a heist" | "..." | "Sure! Anything you say!" | "I'm not a theif" | "I don't like stealing..." | "Wait, that's illegal." | "I will take that as a yes. Come with me, there's this peanut butter I want you to take." | "Good. Come with me, there's this peanut butter I want you to take..." | "Sure. Come with me anyway, there's this peanut butter I want you to take." | "Okay. Come with me anyway, there's this peanut butter I want you to take." | "That's right," Caputia replies, "There's this peanut butter I want you to take."
(After the slime falls from the sky) "This is bad." Caputia turns to you and gives you the peanut butter. "Take this and run. You need to get as far away from here as possible." Caputia grabs your hand. "Stay safe, okay? We may never see each other again..."
"..." | "I get it, it's hard, but, you need to run, got it?" Caputia stands. "If anyone in this village deserves to live, it's you." |
"What? What do you mean? Where are you going?" | "All I can tell you is that I might 
"Good riddance." | 
"But..." | 
"Actually, we will, because you're a part of the main cast" |
