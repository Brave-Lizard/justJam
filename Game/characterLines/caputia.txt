(After the shopping spree with Juliet, you meet up with Caputia.) "Hey," she greets, "How are you doing? Do you like my dialogue?" Caputia flaunts her cool text descriptions that show along with her quotes, "isn't it so cool?"
"..." | "Not impressed? That's okay. I needed you to do something anyway." Caputia asks, "Could you steal something for me?" |
"Yeah, it's pretty great. I wish Juliet had them." | "Well, Juliet will never be as good as me, heh," Caputia brags, puffing out her chest with pride. "You know, there's something I'd like to steal. Can you help me?" |
"It's nothing special." | "Oh, I see, that's a bummer then," she laments, "that's not what I wanted to talk with you about though. There's something I want to steal with you." |
"No, I prefer not to be bombarded with your huge text walls." | "Okay, I'll make sure that narrator keeps quiet then," she says, but will never be able to do, "anyways, there's something we need to do. We need to steal something." |
"It's pretty nice. The narrator's my favorite character anyways." | Aww, thank you.     "Really? You prefer the monotone voice over mine?" Caputia exhales with disapointment. "Hey, there's something I want to do with you. We need to pull off a heist" |
